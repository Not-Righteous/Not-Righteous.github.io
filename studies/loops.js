Loops:
  1. Explain while, for and for-in loops.
    - While Loops:
      ~ Loops through a block of code while a specific condition is true.
      ~ While Loop Example:
        - while (i < 100) {
          //While Loops Body//
        }
    - For Loops:
      ~ Loops through a block of code a number of times.
      ~ For Loop Example:
        - for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
          //For Loop Body//
        }
    - For-In Loops:
      ~ Loops through the properties of an object.
      ~ For-In Loop Example:
        - for (var joy in happy) {
          //For-In Loop Body//
        }
  2. Loop over an Array, forwards and backwards.
    - Loop Forward:
      ~ for (var i = 0; i < example.length; i++) {
        console.log(i);
      }
    - Loop Backwards:
      ~ for (var i = example.length - 1; i > -1; i--) {
        console.log(i);
      }
  3. Loop over an Object.
    - Loop Over Object Example:
      ~ for (var key in object) {
        //Place body here.//
      }
