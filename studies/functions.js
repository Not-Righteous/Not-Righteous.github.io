Functions:
  1. The two phases to using functions: First we must ___? Next we can execute (or two other words for executing a function?) a function by?
    - First phase is to declare, or define a function.
    - Second phase is to call, or apply, or execute the function.
  2. What's the difference between a function's parameters and arguments PASSED to a function?
    - Well how I see it, the parameters are what you put into the parenthesis when you are first creating the function: function example () {}.
    - The arguments is what is placed within the function body that will be executed.
  3. What's the syntax for a NAMED function?
    - function namedFunction (nameOne, nameTwo) {}.
  4. How do we assign a function to a variable?
    - var functionName = function () {}
  5. Functions can OPTIONALLY take inputs, and OPTIONALLY return a single value. How do we specify inputs, and how do we specify outputs?
    - The input for a function is known as parameters which go into the parenthesis.
    - A function will return a single output. By default it will return undefined. But you can use the return keyword which is then followed by a value. 
  6. Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes. The inverse is NOT true.
  7. Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house. If an object returned from the Function and is held in memory somewhere (referenced),
  that closure stays ALIVE, and data can continue to exist in these closures!
