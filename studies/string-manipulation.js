/*
String Manipulation:
  1. With Operators
    - Strings work with the concatenation operator, or (+). It's where two string values are taken and they are
    returned to another string that is together with both operand strings.
  2. With String Methods:
    - Methods are available to primitive values, they are then treated as objects when they are executed using methods.
    - Some String Method Examples:
      ~ string.length()
      ~ toUpperCase()
      ~ toLowerCase()
      ~ replace()
      ~ concat()
